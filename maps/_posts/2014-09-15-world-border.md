description: A world map with stylized borders and an unclear projection.

I have not named this world, but have drawn closer scale versions of parts of it.
This map was drawn during my "stylized borders" phase, yet has relatively plain ones excepting the four flours in each quadrant.
The map is also minimal in that it only shows landmasses, and no rivers, mountains, or political borders.

I intended for this map to be a rough hand-drawn attempt at an equal-area projection.
In the northern hemisphere the parallels are wider apart in the north.
In the southern hemisphere I made a mistake and the parallels follow no good rules.
This throws off the whole concept of using a projection!

This is a map I would like to re-draw someday, perhaps in a vector format.
I do like the border but I think the actual map is lacking in substance.
