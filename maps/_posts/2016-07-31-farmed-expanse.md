It had been a while since I tried to fill in the landmasses of my maps.
I wanted to show mountains as more than cones.
I followed this [tutorial from Fantastic Maps](http://www.fantasticmaps.com/2013/05/quick-mountain-tutorial/).
I think the mountains came out looking good, but they are more of a single ridge and doesn't imply many peaks.

I based the forests off another [Fantastic Maps tutorial](http://www.fantasticmaps.com/2015/01/how-to-draw-forested-hills-on-a-top-down-map) to do the forests.
In practicing the forests, I couldn't get them to look consistent with the mountains.
I don't think this style perfectly meshes with the mountains.

With the new forests and mountains the map still seemed like it was missing something.
I added farmland... but went a little overboard.
