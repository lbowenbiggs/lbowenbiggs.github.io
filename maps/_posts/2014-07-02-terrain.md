I made this map to practice different types of terrains in a clean style.
In the north is a coniferous forest, until it runs into the mountain range.
A deciduous forest takes over on the south of the mountains and runs to the coast in the east.
Farms (or perhaps plains?) take up the large southern biome.

The darker lines represent roads.
The thinner lines that disappear in the forests are rivers.
There are two main cities.
The city on the southern coast is more blocky, representing its newer architecture.
Because it is in the desert, the city did not grow until later.
The other coastal city is represented with a large castle.
Other cities are also represented pictographically.

This map also features an orchard, an ancient shipwreck, some kind of tree-city, and a city hidden in mountains.
