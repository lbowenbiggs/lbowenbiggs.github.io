The dragon curve is my favorite fractal.
One way to construct it is to fold a piece of paper in half many times and unfold.
If all folds are right angles, you'll get something that looks like...

![The Dragon Curve at 5 Folds]({{ site.url }}/assets/dragons/d5_0.png)

If you had a piece of paper with width 0 that you could fold infinitely many times, it would look more like:

![The Dragon Curve at 15 Folds]({{ site.url }}/assets/dragons/d15_0.png)

However, when you fold a piece of paper there are actually two directions you can make the fold.
It turns out that not all fold patterns will generate a Heighway dragon, but they are all non-self intersecting.
Here are some 'degenerate' dragons:

![A degenerate dragon at 5 folds]({{ site.url }}/assets/dragons/d5_6.png)
![A degenerate dragon at 5 folds]({{ site.url }}/assets/dragons/d5_10.png)

Not counting rotations and mirror images, for each number of folds n>1, there are 2^(n-2) unique dragons.
I'm interested in other properties of dragons, and how they work when coded as binary strings.
Some questions I have:

- Do all dragons tile the plane?
- Can you predict the dimensions of a dragon? What does it depend on?
- What would a "3d" dragon curve look like? What would be the algorithm to generate it?
- Could you generate a dragon curve (iterated function system that generates a non-self intersecting curve) on a base-3 alphabet? base-4? What would the algorithm be? How would you visualize it?
- How do binary operations like ~ (bitwise not) or +1 (add 1)  effect the image?

I'm working on a few interactive demos using HTML5 to probe these questions.
You can currently experiment with unfolding dragons from different signatures [here]({{ site.url }}/dragons/).
