# Primarily for me
* helps to organize thoughts
* As a reference for later

## Process
My main audience is myself.
I write for myself because it helps me to collect my thoughts into a coherent text I can reference later.
First I write an outline; I define sections with 2+ distinct statements each.
Then fill in the sections, adding `@TODO` tags in the body as I come across something I don't know yet.
Each statement roughly becomes a paragraph, so if the statement starts becoming more than a paragraph that's a clue that it needs to be split up.
And if I can't come up with more than 1 statement per the topic, it should be combined with another.
Then I find those answers and fill out the full post.
I keep track of references as I go, so I can build an informal bibliography at the end.
