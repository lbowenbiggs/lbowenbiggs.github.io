# Introduction
<!-- This book would make way more sense if you know about Chicago -->
A few weeks ago I finished a book which I'm not sure why I started.
The book was [*The Plan of Chicago: Daniel Burnham and the Creating of an American City* by {{ @TODO ??? }} Smith]({{ @TODO URL?? }}).
Aside from a few layovers at the midway airport, I have never been to Chicago.
Most of what I know about the Chicago urban landscape is from landing and departures from the plane, watching the flat landscape suddenly grow a city.
Lake Michigan looks like an ocean even from up in the plane.
But it turns out that Chicago is not much older than my home state of Oregon.
On the global scale, that makes it a young city, which suggests that the history can be more quickly grasped -- there's less of it.
I suppose it was na√Øve to expect a book of {{ @TODO ???? }} pages focused on only one document in the history of an unfamiliar city to serve as an introduction to urban planning.
Still, it was an interesting read and there's certainly lessons that can be applied to worldbuilding.

<!-- But summarize what the book tried to accomplish anyway -->
For those equally unfamiliar with Chicago as I was, {{ @TODO here's a brief outline and map of what it looks like today vs 1905 }}.
*The Plan of Chicago* does a decent job of explaining the history of the city leading up to the publishing of Daniel Burnham's *The Plan of Chicago*.
It explains how the city was formed, at the confluence of the {{ @TODO }} River and Lake Michigan in an otherwise flat expanse.
Unfortunately, it glosses over certain historic events that were unfamiliar to me as a non-resident without much of a background in US History.
This includes the [Chicago World's Fair]( {{ @TODO Link }}) and the [reversing of the {{ @ TODO }} River]({{ @TODO Link}}).
It then goes on to paint a picture of how the city looked to elite and working-class residents and how people sought to change their city.
Specifically, Daniel Burnham and the Commercial Club of Chicago (a club for wealthy businesses owners) published a meticulously prepared and beautiful tome which they called *The Plan of Chicago*.
In it, they discuss their hopes for an ideal Chicago and propose civic projects to improve the city.
They advertised their plan as a coherent vision of the city, but ultimately not all of their proposals came to fruition.
However, Daniel Burnham himself is still viewed as a visionary in planning.

# Elite planners
<!-- Businesses were heavily involved -->
Burnham seems to have been an honest good guy, perhaps comparable to a Elon Musk (?) or Warren Buffet (?) {{ @TODO Come up with a parallel }}.
He was very wealthy and very well connected.
The plan was written in the early 20th century, a period when businesses were not experiencing the same scrutiny and suspicion that they do now.
{{ @TODO Place in larger context of business vs worker struggle }}
The Commercial Club was made of white male money, but they were legitimately interested in improving life around them.
Granted, they were focused on the efficiency and aesthetics of the city, not the underlying causes of the blight they saw.

If a partnership of this scale were to happen now, how would we react?

* Trickle Down Economics

# What this means for Portland
* Portland is very interested in housing right now
* Roads vs Public transit
* Sometimes it seemed the plan didn't do anything?
* I should really read more history

# What this means for world building
* Traditional fantasy is not developed to the level of industry Chicago had
  * But magic
* Most of my city building is based on what I know (the United States)
* Elites who shape cities, but are not kings
* Public spaces and parks?

# Conclusions
* There's a lot of history I want to read now, history of cities

# Bibliography
*The Plan of Chicago* (The book we're talking about here)
