# Introduction
* This book would make way more sense if you know about Chicago
* But summarize what the book tried to accomplish anyway

# Elite planners
* Businesses were heavily involved
* Trickle Down Economics

# What this means for Portland
* Portland is very interested in housing right now
* Roads vs Public transit
* Sometimes it seemed the plan didn't do anything?
* I should really read more history

# What this means for world building
* Traditional fantasy is not developed to the level of industry Chicago had
  * But magic
* Most of my city building is based on what I know (the United States)
* Elites who shape cities, but are not kings
* Public spaces and parks?

# Conclusions
* There's a lot of history I want to read now, history of cities
