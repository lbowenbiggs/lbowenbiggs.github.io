# Intro
* I used to be on a scholarship for women
* I was really into the women in tech stuff

# Women in tech
* Do I only feel distant because I'm not a woman?
* What these communities provided (when I was in them)
* Was I ever part of it?

# The case for "Gender Diverse" language
* Trans people are left out of "women in tech"
* Trans people have lots of perspectives on this stuff

# How to handle outing?
* Eg, for scholarships. how to let a trans woman apply for a gender diversity scholarship without being outed (eg, to parents)
* "stealth" trans people

# Conclusions
* Include trans people, especially in your money (because we're poor)
