# Intro
* I don't really experience empathy correctly
* So "compassion" arguments don't works
* Vegan friends who cry about sad animals?? I don't feel it but I can see why they do

# Feelings are a logical consequence of consciousness
* I feel things, I am alive. You are probably also alive
* therefore you feel things
* I don't really consider this empathy though

# Animals suffer, even though we can't understand it
* You feel things, but I don't understand them. So do animals
* "But brain structure" ==> But how can we comprehend thoughts and feelings in something fundamentally different than ourselves?
  * Also here's some studies
* It is ethical to reduce suffering

# The environment
* It matters because I want humanity to keep existing after I'm gone
* Also self-preservation

# Animal Ag is unsustainable
* Too many animals is bad because resources, even if ethically treated (actually worse for resources if ethically treated)
* Can feed way more people with less land/water with plants

# Ethics is responsibility for those creatures who are capable of it
* This includes humans
* We are capable of making the ethical choice and therefore we should
