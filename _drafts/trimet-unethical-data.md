Portland Metro has one of the best transit systems in the United States. Granted, I have only ever used the transit systems in Portland, Boston, and (briefly) New York City. One of the things I like about it is the above-ground light rail. Something about being above ground makes it feel brighter, cleaner, and just generally more pleasant. But because it's above ground, the pay-to-enter model does not work. Many stations, especially downtown, are level with the street. There's no "entrance" to the station, so people can walk (or bike) up to the station and enter a train. This is great when the MAX is at the station, since you don't get hung up buying a ticket or using a turn style.

This makes skipping fare very easy.

# Intro
* Trimet is great. Intro to how it works for those not from around here
* But that makes it easy to skip fare (& how that works)

# What could Data give us?
* anecdotal data
* What data can we get?
* Segway to "what if we had real data?" What could we learn? What data would we need?

# How (could) data change behaviour?
* How would that change behavior? People's? Transit Inspectors?
* Would that be a net loss for Trimet? Does that matter?
* Would a fare-inspector tracking app (waze for trimet) be legal? Ethical? How many people would it need to be effective?

# Conclusions
* Pay your fares people
