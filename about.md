I started building and programming robots in high school.
At first it was jut a fun thing to do after class, but pretty soon I was teaching programming across Oregon and thinking about college.
So, I applied to Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
It hasn't been the most traditional of college experiences, but I've learned a lot.

My sophomore year, I came out as transgender.
There's a lot of fascinating books and articles to read, both from historical and contemporary positions.
I am very interested in how technology shapes our experience of gender.

My brothers and I started playing Dungeons and Dragons when I was a kid, and though I haven't been in a consistent game for a while, I am constantly thinking about fantasy worlds and historical world development.
I also hand-draw maps.

Estoy aprendiendo español desde enero 2016.
No soy bilingüe (todavía), pero viajaré a Panamá el proximo diciembre.
Cuando voy, no queiro a parecer tonto.
