# Leon Bowen-Biggs
![Picture of Leon]({{ site.url }}/assets/about_photo.jpg)

I'm a software developer based out of Portland, and a part-time student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.
I also like data, gender theory, worldbuilding, and robotics.

I got into technology through FIRST Robotics in high school, and have worked with LEGO Mindstorms, Arduino-based robots, turtlebots, and a Willow Garage PR2. I have taught classes in robotics programming to hundreds of Oregonians since 2010. I am also interested in challenges robots pose to current infrastructure and social norms.

I am also an amateur artist, and occasionally create maps for my worldbuilding projects.

Generally, most are {{ @TODO }}, unless they are an academic project that cannot release the source.
