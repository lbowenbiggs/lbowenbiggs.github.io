# Leon Bowen-Biggs
![Picture of Leon]({{ site.url }}/assets/about_photo.jpg)

I am a software developer based out of Portland. I am also a part-time student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. My interests include data, gender theory, worldbuliding, and robotics.

I got into technology through FIRST Robotics in high school.  I have taught classes in robotics programming to hundreds of Oregonians since 2010. Some of the robots I have worked with are:

* LEGO Mindstorms
* Arduino-based robotics
* Turtlebots
* Willow Garage PR2

I am also interested in the challenges robots pose to current infrastructure and social norms.

I am also an amateur artist, and occasionally create maps for my worldbuilding projects.
