# How I set this site up
Because I know I'm going to forget, here is what I did.

## 1. Install Ruby and Jekyll
Follow [this tutorial by Sverrir Sigmundarson](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/), steps 1 and 2. I also installed the gems under 'Useful Gems', though have not used them so far.

## 2. Initialize
Follow the [Jekyll Quck-start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/). This creates the file structure needed for the site. Then git init and push as per [the github guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

# Setting up development
If you want to test the site locally, install Ruby and Jekyll (see above), then run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
