For my junior-level project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I developed and analyzed an online e-textbook for the introductory robotics course.

Robotics Engineering E-Book Interactive Qualifying Project, WPI August 2014 - March 2015
 Developed online interactive textbook for introduction to robotics engineering class
 Measured the effect on student learning by running surveys and collecting usage data

# The Website

* Focus on content for students, but with interactive pieces
* Vocab and quizzes built into the pages with instant feedback

# Metrics & Results
* Used google analytics to track visits
* Required students to use the site for homework, which is the only time they visited the site
