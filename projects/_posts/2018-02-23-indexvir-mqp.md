My Major Qualifying Project (MQP) at Worcester Polytechnic is to build a searchable, extendable online database to hold 25 years of research on the history of the print trade in Virginia.
The website is built using Django and MySQL and is available at [https://beta.indexvirginiaprinting.org](beta.indexvirginiaprinting.org).
The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/lbowenbiggs/virginia-printing-db).
