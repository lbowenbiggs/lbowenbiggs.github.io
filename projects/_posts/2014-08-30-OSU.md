In the summer of 2014 I worked in the Personal Robotics Laboratory at Oregon State University.
Our lab worked on human-robot interaction regarding privacy expectations with mobile robots.

Some attributions are listed under my previous name, Penn Biggs.

# Privacy Expectations
Our objective was to test if users felt their privacy needs were upheld when using a mobile robot streaming video data.
We also tested the impact of the privacy systems on their performance.
We developed a system in ROS that applied different filters to "private" video data, and created a user study to test if these filters impacted their tasks.

# Map Registration

Robots can use maps they generate to navigate physical spaces.
These maps, called SLAM maps, are not a clean representation of the physical space.
We wanted to give the user a cleaner and easier-to-read map, and provide a correspondence between the two maps.

I built the map registration tool to create this correspondence.
It can be found on [github under the "map_registration" directory](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/Privacy-GUI).
The tool works by transforming the polygons between corresponding points.
A more detailed explanation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/Privacy-GUI/wiki/Map-Registration-Transformation).

A paper based on this tool, ["A Method for Establishing Correspondences between Hand-Drawn and Sensor-Generated Maps"](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~smartw/papers?q=papers&display=detail&tag=icsr2016), was published in 2016.
User's performance in locating objects in a room was measured using the two different maps.
No statistical difference was found between the two maps.
