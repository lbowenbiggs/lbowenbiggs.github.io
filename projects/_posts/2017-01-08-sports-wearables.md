I worked in the New Devices group at Intel developing firmware for demonstrations on the Curie module.
I also supported the Sports IQ Demos at CES 2017.

# Intel Curie & Arduino 101
The Intel Curie module powers the [Arduino 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101). During my internship, I worked on some of the firmware in the Curie. Because this was a new product and I was working with unreleased hardware, I extended driver functions and was responsible for maintenance of our group's fork of the RTOS. I also educated coworkers and new interns on working with the Curie module by assisting in projects and doing code reviews.

# Sports IQ at CES
At [CES 2017](https://iq.intel.com/ces-2017-tech-pushes-performance/), Intel had professional dunkers on a miniature basketball court using wearable technology based on Curie. The software collected data from the jumps and dunks and wirelessly transmitted it to a central device that showed off the statistics. Other demos I worked on captured data locally on the device for big-data analytics later.
